### Release 0.2.0
<sup>2026-01-16</sup>

This release from a client standpoint is a minor change- the actions list has been moved to its own row in the Combatant view, and there are now some fancy tooltips to indicate what each button does.
Under the hood, this is a fairly major refactor that opens the way for many of the changes I'm hopeful to enable in the future for better automation.
