### Release 1.1.0
<sup>2026-01-25</sup>

- Can now track and prevent combatants from using more actions or reactions than they have available
- Added a setting which determines behavior on a combatant using too many actions, either:
    - Do nothing
    - Display a warning message to the player using the action, but allow the action to occur and add it to the tracker
    - Display a warning message to the player using the action, and prevent the action from being used (in either the tracker or the chat)
