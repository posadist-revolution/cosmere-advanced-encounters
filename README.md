# Cosmere Advanced Encounters

A module that will be updated to add combat-specific automations and enhancements which are too potentally videogamey for the main Cosmere RPG project.

## Current Features

 - Adds an action tracker to each combatant in a combat, with each action type clickable for manual usage/restoration of actions/reactions
 - The action tracker resets on the start of every combatant's turn, on the start of every round, or never (configurable by setting)
 - Pulls actions used in the chat onto the combatant tracker for easy viewing (configurable by setting)
